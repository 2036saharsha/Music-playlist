## A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Our users, any average human being, want to groove about their day, rather than move
about their day. As it stands, music is becoming more and more available with streaming services
like Apple Music, Spotify and many others. As music becomes more accessible, the dramatic
increase of options at our fingertips makes choosing what to listen to even harder. People
nowadays donâ€™t want to take the time to queue their own playlist, they want that process
automated so that they can enjoy a playlist that compliments the activity they are participating in,
whatever it may be.


## Installation

Run these following command in your terminal to setup : 

```bash
  pip3 install pywhatkit
```

```bash
  pip3 install requests
```

Once set up, run main.py.

## To-do/potential improvements for Phase 5:

- Implement GUI for the Calendar & command line
- Add support for SoundCloud/Spotify playback
